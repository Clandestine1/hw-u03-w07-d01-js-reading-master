5. Suppose Javascript had no map method, how would you write it?
6. What is a Javascript prototype?
7. What is a prototype chain? What is an example?
8. What is the Javascript data type that has no prototype?
9. How does Object.create() affect the prototype chain?
10. How do you check to see if an object has a property defined on itself rather than somewhere up the protoype chain?
